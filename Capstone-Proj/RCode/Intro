This file includes the R Markdown code that I used to produce the project, along with the data files necessary to run it. The individual 
zipcode level files are not included, because they are downloadable from the FEC website and the data they contains is compiled in both 
the output files.

Inputs to R code:
- List of Silicon Valley zipcodes [siliconvalley-zip.xlsx]
- List of candidates participating in the CA primaries in each cycle [cand08,12,16.xlsx]
- List of the party affiliations of each candidate who participated in the CA primaries [candPARTY.xlsx]

Outputs from R code:
- Dataset of contributions from the full 2008 and 2012 cycles, and the 2016 cycle through end of May [full_data.csv]
- Dataset of contributions from the prorated segment of the 2008 cycle and the 2016 cycle through the end of May [proport0816.csv]
